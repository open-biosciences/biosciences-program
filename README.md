# Open Biosciences 🧬

> AI agents grounded in verifiable biological truth — from fuzzy questions to validated knowledge graphs.

Open Biosciences is an open-source platform for accelerating drug discovery and biomedical research by connecting AI agents to the world's authoritative life-sciences databases. Researchers ask questions in natural language. The platform resolves them to canonical identifiers, validates every claim against primary sources, and returns traceable knowledge graphs — not hallucinated summaries.

## Why This Exists

Life sciences researchers spend 60–80% of their time on data wrangling: querying fragmented APIs, reconciling incompatible identifiers (BRCA1 is `HGNC:1100` in HGNC, `P38398` in UniProt, `ENSG00000012048` in Ensembl), and stitching together facts that should flow seamlessly. AI assistants promise to automate this — but a bare LLM will confidently invent drug mechanisms, fabricate trial IDs, and conflate gene symbols. The cost of a wrong answer in biomedicine is not a bad chatbot experience; it is wasted lab time or a misleading grant application.

The platform enforces a **Fuzzy-to-Fact protocol**: every entity is first searched in natural language, then resolved to a canonical identifier (a CURIE), then validated against the authoritative database. No claim leaves the system unverified.

## Origin

This platform evolved through three distinct implementations before becoming a public organization.

**Chapter 1 — Prototype (Claude Code Skills, 2025):** Six domain skills (`.claude/skills/`) in a single private repo proved the Fuzzy-to-Fact protocol worked. Researchers could resolve gene symbols, fetch drug-target associations, and build knowledge graph fragments — all from the Claude Code CLI. The limitation: everything was session-scoped and terminal-only.

**Chapter 2 — Interactive Research (Deep Agents):** The prototype grew into a LangGraph supervisor with 7 specialist subagents — one per research phase (ANCHOR → ENRICH → EXPAND → TRAVERSE → VALIDATE → PERSIST). A streaming React UI made the reasoning visible. Think-Act-Observe loops made it rigorous. The FOP drug-discovery walkthrough (resolving "ACVR1" to `HGNC:171`, finding Palovarotene in Open Targets, verifying `NCT03312634` in ClinicalTrials.gov) demonstrated the protocol at clinical depth.

**Chapter 3 — Production (Temporal Workflows):** PydanticAI agents wired to Temporal.io activities brought durable execution: workflows survive crashes, retry failed API calls, and run batch pipelines at scale. The same 12-database MCP backbone underlies all three implementations.

**The org migration** is the moment all three converge. `lifesciences-research` became `biosciences-mcp` (the API layer) and `biosciences-architecture` (the governance). The agents became `biosciences-deepagents` and `biosciences-temporal`. The skills became `biosciences-skills`. A private experiment became a public platform.

## Research Scenarios

The platform is built around concrete research questions: *"What are the synthetic lethal partners for ARID1A in ovarian cancer?"* or *"What drugs target the ACVR1 pathway in fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva?"* Each question exercises the full 12-database stack — gene resolution, protein interactions, drug candidates, clinical trials — and produces a validated knowledge graph with full provenance.

→ Competency questions catalog: [biosciences-research](https://github.com/open-biosciences/biosciences-research)
→ Live API layer (12 servers): [biosciences-mcp](https://github.com/open-biosciences/biosciences-mcp)

## Get Involved

The platform is MIT-licensed and structured for external contribution. Here are three entry points depending on your background:

**Researcher** — Start with the competency questions catalog in [biosciences-research](https://github.com/open-biosciences/biosciences-research). Each scenario documents the research question, the databases queried, and re-run instructions. You can run any scenario today against the live MCP layer.

**Developer** — The MCP layer is the most accessible contribution surface. Each server is an independent FastMCP wrapper for a public API. If you work with a database not yet covered (KEGG, OMIM, Orphanet), the SpecKit scaffold workflow in [biosciences-skills](https://github.com/open-biosciences/biosciences-skills) generates a compliant server skeleton from a spec. Adding a new MCP server is a self-contained, well-scoped contribution.

**AI/LLM Builder** — The Fuzzy-to-Fact protocol (ADR-001) and SpecKit SDLC (ADR-003) are reusable patterns, not just biosciences artifacts. The architecture documents in [biosciences-architecture](https://github.com/open-biosciences/biosciences-architecture) explain the design decisions. The 9-agent team topology is a template for how to structure AI-assisted development of complex platforms.

## Built On Open Science

This platform wraps 20+ years of bioinformatics API work. STRING, STITCH, NCATS Translator, and BioThings Explorer established the patterns for federated biological data access that make this platform possible. We do not redistribute upstream data — we wrap public APIs and return live results. Every MCP server is a lightweight client; the authoritative data remains with the institutions that curate it.

The novel contributions are methodological: the Fuzzy-to-Fact protocol, the SpecKit specification-driven SDLC, the Agentic Biolink schema (a unified JSON envelope across 12 heterogeneous APIs), and the 9-agent team topology for AI-assisted platform development.
