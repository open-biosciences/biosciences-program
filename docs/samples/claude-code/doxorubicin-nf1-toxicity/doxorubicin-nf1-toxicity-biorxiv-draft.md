## Abstract

**Background.** Doxorubicin is essential for treating NF1-associated malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs), yet dose-limiting cardiotoxicity mediated by off-target TOP2B inhibition poses particular challenges for NF1 patients requiring prolonged treatment.

**Methods.** We applied the Fuzzy-to-Fact protocol, a seven-phase systematic knowledge graph construction method, to the competency question: "What known genes or pathways are implicated in minimizing doxorubicin toxicity while preserving its anti-tumor efficacy for NF1?" Entity resolution, enrichment, network expansion, drug/trial traversal, and validation were performed across 10 biomedical databases (HGNC, UniProt, Open Targets, STRING, ChEMBL, PubChem, WikiPathways, ClinicalTrials.gov, Ensembl, Entrez) via MCP tool calls. Results were grounded against Synapse.org datasets and assessed using a 10-dimension quality framework.

**Results.** The resulting knowledge graph contains 18 nodes and 20 edges spanning three cardioprotective axes: (1) TOP2B degradation by dexrazoxane (L4 evidence, Phase 4 approved); (2) NRF2/KEAP1-mediated antioxidant response activating HMOX1, NQO1, and SOD2 (L2 evidence); and (3) NF1-specific MEK inhibition via selumetinib reducing reliance on high-dose doxorubicin (L4 evidence, FDA-approved for NF1 plexiform neurofibromas). Six clinical trials were verified, including doxorubicin-based MPNST chemotherapy (NCT00304083), selumetinib for NF1 (NCT02407405, NCT03433183), and emerging cardioprotective strategies (NCT03930680, NCT05271162, NCT07370506). Synapse grounding identified 8 datasets supporting 10/18 nodes and 7/20 edges.

**Conclusion.** Three distinct but complementary cardioprotective strategies emerge for NF1 patients receiving doxorubicin: direct TOP2B modulation, endogenous antioxidant pathway activation, and NF1-specific MEK inhibition enabling potential dose reduction. The absence of a clinical trial testing doxorubicin cardiotoxicity specifically in NF1 patients represents a critical evidence gap.

## 1. Introduction

Doxorubicin (CHEMBL:53463) is an anthracycline antibiotic that remains a cornerstone of chemotherapy regimens for aggressive solid tumors, including NF1-associated malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) [1]. Its anti-tumor efficacy derives from inhibition of DNA topoisomerase II alpha (TOP2A, HGNC:11989), which is enriched in proliferating tumor cells [2, 3]. However, dose-limiting cardiotoxicity constrains cumulative exposure and remains a leading cause of treatment-related morbidity in cancer survivors [4].

Neurofibromatosis type 1 (MONDO:0018975) is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by loss-of-function mutations in the NF1 gene (HGNC:7765), which encodes neurofibromin, a Ras-GTPase activating protein (Ras-GAP) [5, 6]. NF1 loss leads to constitutive activation of the RAS-MAPK pathway via KRAS (HGNC:6407) and downstream effectors [7]. MPNSTs develop in approximately 8-13% of NF1 patients and are treated with doxorubicin-based regimens, as demonstrated in NCT00304083 [8]. The intersection of doxorubicin cardiotoxicity with NF1-specific pathway dysregulation creates a unique clinical challenge: NF1 patients may require prolonged anthracycline exposure while potentially harboring altered cardiac stress responses due to RAS-MAPK dysregulation.

Despite extensive research on doxorubicin cardiotoxicity mechanisms, no systematic multi-database analysis has addressed this question specifically in the NF1 context. We applied the Fuzzy-to-Fact protocol -- a structured seven-phase approach to biomedical knowledge graph construction -- to systematically identify genes, pathways, and therapeutic strategies that minimize doxorubicin cardiotoxicity while preserving anti-tumor efficacy for NF1 patients.

## 2. Methods

### 2.1 Fuzzy-to-Fact Protocol

The Fuzzy-to-Fact protocol is a seven-phase systematic approach to transforming competency questions into structured, evidence-graded knowledge graphs:

| Phase | Name | Objective |
|-------|------|-----------|
| 1 | ANCHOR | Resolve ambiguous entity names to canonical database identifiers |
| 2 | ENRICH | Retrieve functional annotations, disease associations, and cross-references |
| 3 | EXPAND | Discover interaction partners and pathway memberships |
| 4a | TRAVERSE_DRUGS | Identify drugs targeting graph entities and their mechanisms |
| 4b | TRAVERSE_TRIALS | Find clinical trials testing relevant interventions |
| 5 | VALIDATE | Verify key identifiers and cross-check data consistency |
| 6 | PERSIST | Structure results as knowledge graph JSON and narrative report |

### 2.2 Data Sources

All data were retrieved programmatically via MCP (Model Context Protocol) tool calls to 10 biomedical databases:

| Database | Tool | Data Retrieved |
|----------|------|---------------|
| HGNC | `hgnc_search_genes`, `hgnc_get_gene` | Gene symbols, CURIEs, loci, cross-references |
| UniProt | `uniprot_get_protein` | Protein function, subcellular localization |
| Open Targets | `opentargets_get_target`, `opentargets_get_associations`, GraphQL `knownDrugs` | Disease associations, drug-target relationships, mechanisms |
| STRING | `string_get_interactions` | Protein-protein interactions with confidence scores |
| ChEMBL | `chembl_search_compounds` | Compound identifiers |
| PubChem | `pubchem_get_compound` | Molecular formulas |

| Ensembl | Via HGNC cross-reference | Ensembl gene IDs |
| Entrez | Via HGNC cross-reference | NCBI Gene IDs |

### 2.3 Evidence Grading

Each claim in the knowledge graph was graded on a four-level scale with modifiers:

| Level | Score Range | Criteria |
|-------|------------|----------|
| L4 Clinical | 0.90-1.00 | FDA-approved or Phase 2+ with published endpoints |
| L3 Functional | 0.70-0.89 | Multi-DB concordance + druggable target |
| L2 Multi-DB | 0.50-0.69 | 2+ independent databases confirm |
| L1 Single-DB | 0.30-0.49 | One database source only |

Modifiers: active trial (+0.10), mechanism match (+0.10), literature support (+0.05), high STRING score (+0.05), conflicting evidence (-0.10), single source (-0.10), unverified (-0.15), mechanism mismatch (-0.20).

### 2.4 Synapse.org Grounding

Knowledge graph nodes and edges were cross-referenced against Synapse.org datasets using the `search_synapse`, `get_entity`, `get_entity_annotations`, and `get_entity_children` MCP tools. Eight search queries were executed targeting compound-disease, gene-compound, and pathway combinations. Grounding strength was classified as Strong (direct perturbation), Moderate (relevant profiling), or Weak (contextual support).

### 2.5 Quality Assessment

The report was evaluated using a 10-dimension quality framework assessing: CURIE resolution, source attribution, LOCATE-RETRIEVE pattern, disease CURIE presence, Open Targets pagination, evidence grading, gain-of-function filter, trial validation, completeness, and hallucination risk.

### 3.2 Mechanistic Findings: Three Cardioprotective Axes

#### Axis 1: TOP2B Degradation (L4 Evidence)

Doxorubicin's anti-tumor efficacy operates through inhibition of TOP2A (HGNC:11989, ENSG00000131747), while cardiotoxicity is mediated by off-target inhibition of TOP2B (HGNC:11990, ENSG00000077097) in post-mitotic cardiomyocytes [2, 3, 9]. TOP2A and TOP2B interact with STRING confidence 0.973 [10], reflecting their shared topoisomerase function but distinct tissue expression profiles.

Dexrazoxane (CHEMBL:1738) is the only FDA-approved cardioprotectant for anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity (Phase 4) [9]. It acts as a DNA topoisomerase II inhibitor that degrades TOP2B protein in cardiomyocytes, preventing doxorubicin-TOP2B complex formation. Trial NCT03930680 (COMPLETED) demonstrated 95% reduction in TOP2B within 8 hours of dexrazoxane administration [11].

TDP2 (HGNC:17768) repairs TOP2B-mediated DNA double-strand breaks (STRING score 0.820 with TOP2B) [10], representing an endogenous repair mechanism for TOP2B-mediated damage.

#### Axis 2: NRF2/KEAP1 Antioxidant Response (L2 Evidence)

NFE2L2 (HGNC:7782), also known as NRF2, is a bZIP transcription factor that binds antioxidant response elements (ARE) in promoter regions of cytoprotective genes [12]. Under basal conditions, NRF2 is ubiquitinated by KEAP1 (HGNC:23177) and degraded [12]. Upon oxidative stress (including doxorubicin-induced ROS generation), NRF2 translocates to the nucleus and activates:

- **HMOX1** (HGNC:5013): Heme oxygenase 1; anti-inflammatory heme catabolism [13]
- **NQO1** (HGNC:2874): NAD(P)H quinone dehydrogenase 1; catalyzes two-electron reduction of quinones, bypassing toxic superoxide generation [13]
- **SOD2** (HGNC:11180): Superoxide dismutase 2 (MnSOD); destroys superoxide anion radicals in mitochondria [14]

#### Axis 3: NF1-Specific MEK Inhibition (L4 Evidence)

NF1 (HGNC:7765) encodes neurofibromin, a Ras-GAP that stimulates GTPase activity of KRAS (HGNC:6407), inactivating it (STRING score 0.996) [5, 6, 7]. NF1 loss-of-function causes constitutive RAS-MAPK activation through the RAF/MAP kinase cascade (WP:WP2735) [15], driving tumor growth in NF1-associated MPNSTs.

Selumetinib (CHEMBL:1614701) is an FDA-approved MEK1/2 inhibitor for NF1-associated inoperable plexiform neurofibromas (Phase 4) [16]. By targeting MEK1/2 downstream of the NF1-RAS axis, selumetinib may reduce tumor burden, potentially lowering the cumulative doxorubicin dose required and thereby reducing cardiotoxicity exposure. Clinical trials NCT02407405 (Phase II, ACTIVE_NOT_RECRUITING) and NCT03433183 (selumetinib + sirolimus for NF1-MPNST, COMPLETED) provide evidence for this strategy [17, 18].

### 3.3 Clinical Trials

Six clinical trials were identified and verified via `clinicaltrials_get_trial`:

| NCT ID | Intervention | Status | NF1-Relevant | Evidence Level |
|--------|-------------|--------|-------------|---------------|
| NCT00304083 | Doxorubicin + etoposide + ifosfamide (MPNST) | COMPLETED | Yes | L4 (0.90) |
| NCT02407405 | Selumetinib (NF1 plexiform neurofibromas) | ACTIVE_NOT_RECRUITING | Yes | L4 (1.00) |
| NCT03433183 | Selumetinib + Sirolimus (NF1-MPNST) | COMPLETED | Yes | L4 (0.90) |
| NCT03930680 | Dexrazoxane (cardioprotection) | COMPLETED | No | L4 (1.00) |
| NCT05271162 | Empagliflozin SGLT2i (cardioprotection) | RECRUITING | No | L2 (0.60) |
| NCT07370506 | Telmisartan ARB (DOX cardiotoxicity) | NOT_YET_RECRUITING | No | L2 (0.50) |

Median evidence score: 0.60 (L2 Multi-DB). No claims below L1.

## 4. Discussion

### 4.1 Key Findings

This systematic analysis identifies three distinct cardioprotective strategies for NF1 patients receiving doxorubicin:

1. **Direct TOP2B modulation** via dexrazoxane represents the most well-established approach (L4 evidence), with the specific advantage of preventing the molecular event (TOP2B-DNA cleavage complex formation) that initiates cardiotoxicity.

2. **NRF2/KEAP1 pathway activation** provides endogenous cytoprotection through multiple effector genes (HMOX1, NQO1, SOD2). While well-characterized at the molecular level, therapeutic exploitation of this axis in the doxorubicin-cardiac context remains at L2 evidence.

3. **NF1-specific MEK inhibition** via selumetinib represents a novel, disease-specific strategy. By targeting the NF1-RAS-MAPK axis that drives tumor growth, MEK inhibitors may enable reduced doxorubicin dosing, indirectly lowering cardiotoxicity. This strategy is uniquely relevant to NF1 patients and is supported by FDA approval of selumetinib for NF1 plexiform neurofibromas.

### 4.2 Competency Question Methodology

The Fuzzy-to-Fact protocol demonstrated several strengths for this analysis:

- **Multi-database concordance** across HGNC, UniProt, Open Targets, STRING, and WikiPathways provided robust entity resolution and cross-validation
- **Claim-level evidence grading** with numeric scores and explicit modifiers enables transparent assessment of evidence strength
- **Synapse.org grounding** connected computational predictions to experimental datasets, with 3 Strong and 5 Moderate matches identified

### 4.3 Synapse Validation

The Synapse grounding revealed that the strongest experimental support exists for the TOP2B-dexrazoxane axis (syn200548, direct cardiac profiling) and the NF1-selumetinib axis (syn44222814, syn61259950). The NRF2 pathway has moderate support from non-cardiac models (syn205590, syn237499), highlighting a gap in cardiac-specific NRF2 activation studies.

### 4.4 Limitations

1. **No NF1-doxorubicin cardiac trial exists.** Whether NF1 patients have differential doxorubicin cardiotoxicity risk is unknown. The NF1-cardiac axis hypothesis (NF1 loss altering cardiomyocyte RAS-MAPK stress responses) remains theoretical (L1).

2. **No quantitative selectivity data.** IC50/Ki values for doxorubicin binding to TOP2A versus TOP2B were not available from MCP tool queries, preventing quantitative selectivity assessment.

3. **Cross-species Synapse data.** The strongest cardiac dataset (syn200548, E-MEXP-2071) uses rat tissue. Human iPSC-CM studies (syn7079983, syn13856689) test TKIs rather than doxorubicin.

4. **NRF2 tissue specificity.** Synapse NRF2 datasets derive from liver (syn205590) and lung (syn237499) tissues. Cardiac NRF2 biology is extrapolated from these models.

5. **MEK inhibitor + doxorubicin combination.** No clinical trial examines concurrent MEK inhibition and doxorubicin for cardioprotective benefit in NF1 patients. The dose-reduction hypothesis lacks direct experimental validation.

### 4.5 Future Directions

1. A retrospective analysis of NF1-MPNST patients treated with doxorubicin-based regimens could assess whether NF1 status correlates with differential cardiotoxicity risk.
2. A preclinical study combining selumetinib with doxorubicin in NF1-deficient cardiomyocyte models could directly test the NF1-cardiac axis hypothesis.
3. Cardiac-specific NRF2 activation studies using doxorubicin-treated human iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes would strengthen the NRF2 axis evidence from L2 to L3.

### Figure Descriptions

**Figure 1: Knowledge Graph Topology.** The knowledge graph contains 18 nodes (11 genes, 3 compounds, 3 pathways, 2 diseases) connected by 20 edges (4 INHIBITOR, 5 REGULATES, 2 INTERACTS, 2 ASSOCIATED_WITH, 7 MEMBER_OF). Hub nodes are TOP2B (degree 5: connected to DOX, DEX, cardiomyopathy, TOP2A, TDP2) and NFE2L2 (degree 5: connected to KEAP1, HMOX1, NQO1, SOD2, WP:WP3). The graph bifurcates into a cardiotoxicity subgraph (DOX-TOP2A/TOP2B-cardiomyopathy) and an NF1-RAS-MAPK subgraph (NF1-KRAS-selumetinib), bridged by the shared therapeutic context.

**Figure 2: Three-Axis Cardioprotective Model.** (A) Axis 1: Dexrazoxane degrades TOP2B in cardiomyocytes, preventing doxorubicin-TOP2B cleavage complex formation. (B) Axis 2: NRF2 activation (released from KEAP1 inhibition) drives transcription of HMOX1, NQO1, and SOD2, providing antioxidant defense against doxorubicin-induced ROS. (C) Axis 3: Selumetinib inhibits MEK1/2 downstream of NF1-loss-activated KRAS, potentially reducing tumor burden and cumulative doxorubicin exposure.
