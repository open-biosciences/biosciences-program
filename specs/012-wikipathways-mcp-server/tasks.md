# Tasks: WikiPathways MCP Server

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/012-wikipathways-mcp-server/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: Not explicitly requested in specification - implementation tasks only

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3, US4)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-6)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 → P1 → P2 → P3)
- **Polish (Phase 7)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: search_pathways - Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P1)**: get_pathway - Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Independent of US1 but pairs with it for Fuzzy-to-Fact workflow
- **User Story 3 (P2)**: get_pathways_for_gene - Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Independent of US1/US2 but reuses PathwaySearchCandidate model
- **User Story 4 (P3)**: get_pathway_components - Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Independent but uses pathway ID validation from US2

### Within Each User Story

- Models before client methods
- Client methods before MCP tools
- MCP tools before integration tests
- Core implementation before error handling
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

- **Phase 1 (Setup)**: T002, T003, T004 can run in parallel (different files)
- **Phase 2 (Foundational)**: T010, T011, T014, T015, T016 can run in parallel
- **Phase 3 (US1)**: T017 can start immediately, integration tests T027-T030 can run in parallel after implementation
- **Phase 4 (US2)**: T032 can start immediately, integration tests T044-T047 can run in parallel after implementation
- **Phase 5 (US3)**: Integration tests T060-T063 can run in parallel after implementation
- **Phase 6 (US4)**: T065, T066, T067 can run in parallel, integration tests T078-T081 can run in parallel after implementation
- **Phase 7 (Polish)**: T083, T084, T085, T086, T093, T094 can run in parallel

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Launch model creation (T017) immediately after foundational phase:
Task: "Implement PathwaySearchCandidate Pydantic model"

# After implementation, launch all integration tests in parallel:
Task: "Add integration test for US1 Scenario 1 (glycolysis search)"
Task: "Add integration test for US1 Scenario 2 (pagination)"
Task: "Add integration test for US1 Scenario 3 (empty results)"
Task: "Add integration test for US1 Scenario 4 (no organism filter)"
```

---

## Parallel Example: Foundational Phase

```bash
# Launch all independent model and configuration tasks:
Task: "Implement RevisionMetadata Pydantic model"
Task: "Implement ComponentCounts Pydantic model"
Task: "Add WikiPathwaysClient export to clients/__init__.py"
Task: "Create integration test file stub"
Task: "Create unit test file stubs"
```

---

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 + User Story 2 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (search_pathways)
4. Complete Phase 4: User Story 2 (get_pathway)
5. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test Fuzzy-to-Fact workflow (search → get_pathway) independently
6. Deploy/demo if ready

**Rationale**: Stories 1 and 2 together implement the core Fuzzy-to-Fact protocol and provide immediate value for pathway discovery and detailed information retrieval.

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational → Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 + User Story 2 → Test Fuzzy-to-Fact workflow → Deploy/Demo (MVP!)
3. Add User Story 3 → Test reverse gene lookup independently → Deploy/Demo
4. Add User Story 4 → Test component extraction independently → Deploy/Demo
5. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1 (search_pathways)
   - Developer B: User Story 2 (get_pathway)
   - Developer C: User Story 3 (get_pathways_for_gene)
   - Developer D: User Story 4 (get_pathway_components)
3. Stories complete and integrate independently
4. Convergence at Phase 7 (Polish)

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- All tasks follow the strict checklist format: `- [ ] [ID] [P?] [Story?] Description with file path`
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts, cross-story dependencies that break independence
- Cross-reference mapping uses WikiPathways bulk JSON file (findPathwaysByXref.json) for efficiency
- Rate limiting: Conservative 1 req/sec with exponential backoff on 429/503 responses
- All API responses wrapped in Canonical Pagination or Error envelopes per ADR-001 §8
