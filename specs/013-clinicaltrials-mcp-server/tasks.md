# Tasks: ClinicalTrials.gov MCP Server

**Feature Branch**: `013-clinicaltrials-mcp-server`
**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/013-clinicaltrials-mcp-server/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/, quickstart.md

**Tests**: All user stories include test tasks per feature specification requirements (FR-022, FR-023, FR-024)

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `- [ ] [ID] [P?] [Story?] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3, US4)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

---

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Project initialization and basic structure

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-6)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 → P2 → P3 → P4)
- **Polish (Phase 7)**: Depends on all user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on US1 (independently testable)
- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on US1/US2 (independently testable)
- **User Story 4 (P4)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Builds on error handling from all tools

### Within Each User Story

- Tests MUST be written and FAIL before implementation
- Models before client methods
- Client methods before FastMCP tools
- Core implementation before integration
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

- **Phase 1**: T002 and T003 (different model files)
- **Phase 2**: T006, T007, T009, T010, T012 (different concerns within client/models)
- **Phase 3 (US1)**: All test tasks (T013-T019) can run in parallel
- **Phase 4 (US2)**: All test tasks (T028-T035) can run in parallel
- **Phase 5 (US3)**: All test tasks (T046-T051) can run in parallel
- **Phase 6 (US4)**: All test tasks (T058-T063) can run in parallel
- **Phase 7**: T071, T072, T073, T074, T075, T076, T077 (independent validation tasks)
- **Cross-story**: Once Foundational completes, US1, US2, US3 can start in parallel by different developers

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1 (Fuzzy Trial Search)

```bash
# Launch all tests for User Story 1 together (write tests first, ensure they FAIL):
Task: "Unit test for TrialSearchCandidate model validation"
Task: "Unit test for PaginationEnvelope structure"
Task: "Integration test for simple query search"
Task: "Integration test for multi-filter search"
Task: "Integration test for location-based search"
Task: "Integration test for phase filter search"
Task: "Integration test for pagination workflow"

# After tests are written and failing, implement:
Task: "Implement search_trials client method with query parameters"
Task: "Add API fields parameter for minimal search response"
Task: "Implement response parsing to TrialSearchCandidate"
Task: "Implement PaginationEnvelope wrapping with cursor mapping"
Task: "Add parameter validation for status and phase enums"
Task: "Implement @mcp.tool() decorator for search_trials"
Task: "Add tool description and parameter documentation"
Task: "Run all US1 tests and verify they pass"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup (T001-T004)
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (T005-T012) - CRITICAL - blocks all stories
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (T013-T027)
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 1 independently
5. Deploy/demo fuzzy trial search capability

**Result**: LLM agents can discover clinical trials using natural language queries

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational → Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo (MVP - Fuzzy Search!)
3. Add User Story 2 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo (Fuzzy-to-Fact complete!)
4. Add User Story 3 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo (Location data added!)
5. Add User Story 4 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo (Error recovery complete!)
6. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1 (Fuzzy Search)
   - Developer B: User Story 2 (Strict Lookup)
   - Developer C: User Story 3 (Locations)
3. Stories complete independently and integrate seamlessly
4. Developer D (optional): User Story 4 error recovery testing across all tools

---

## Task Summary

**Total Tasks**: 79

**Task Count by User Story**:
- Setup (Phase 1): 4 tasks
- Foundational (Phase 2): 8 tasks
- User Story 1 (P1): 15 tasks (7 tests + 8 implementation)
- User Story 2 (P2): 18 tasks (8 tests + 10 implementation)
- User Story 3 (P3): 12 tasks (6 tests + 6 implementation)
- User Story 4 (P4): 13 tasks (6 tests + 7 implementation)
- Polish (Phase 7): 9 tasks

**Parallel Opportunities**: 38 tasks marked [P] can run in parallel

**Independent Test Criteria**:
- **US1**: Search for "breast cancer immunotherapy" → verify ranked candidates with NCT IDs
- **US2**: Call get_trial("NCT:01234567") → verify complete trial details
- **US3**: Call get_trial_locations("NCT:04123456") → verify facility/contact data
- **US4**: Trigger error scenarios → verify recovery hints enable self-correction

**Suggested MVP Scope**: User Story 1 only (fuzzy search capability)

---

## Format Validation

✅ All tasks follow the checklist format: `- [ ] [TaskID] [P?] [Story?] Description with file path`

✅ All user story phase tasks include [Story] labels (US1, US2, US3, US4)

✅ All tasks include specific file paths

✅ Setup and Foundational phases have no story labels (shared infrastructure)

✅ Polish phase has no story labels (cross-cutting concerns)

---

## Notes

- Tests are REQUIRED per feature specification (FR-022, FR-023, FR-024)
- All tests must FAIL before implementation (TDD workflow)
- NCT ID format: NCT:######## (8 digits with colon)
- Rate limiting: 1 req/sec with exponential backoff
- Token optimization: Search returns ~100-200 tokens/candidate, strict lookup returns ~5K-10K tokens/trial
- Cross-references: Limited to PubMed, MeSH IDs, registry links (no direct DrugBank/ChEMBL links)
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
